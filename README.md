# Alpha
## Introduction
Alpha is a simple & efficient AI framework written in C. It attempts to provide an alternative to the existing AI frameworks, while attempting to bring the C programming language to the forefront of the AI industry.
## Planning
Alpha is currently in the planning stages. Alpha (as a project) plans to internally implement it's handling of complex mathematical constructs (such as the handling of matrices, vectors, etc.) internally without relying on other mathematical libraries (except for `libm`). Alpha plans to primarily use OpenMP for parallelization, as it's much more cross-platform than other parallelization frameworks, and because it also supports GPU offloading.
